# This program calculates store and employee bonuses based on monthly sales and sales increase percentage.

# declare local variables

storeAmount = 0  # store bonus amount
empAmount = 75  # employee bonus amount
salesIncrease = 30  # percent of sales increase
prompt = " 15 "  # prompt will be a string literal

# This code gets the monthly sales
monthlySales = float(input(prompt))

# This code determines the store bonus

    storeAmount = 3000
else:
    storeAmount = 0

# This code gets the percent of increase in sales
salesIncrease = float(input("Enter the percent increase in sales: "))
salesIncrease = salesIncrease / 100

# This code determines the employee bonus
